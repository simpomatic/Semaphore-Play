# Semaphore Play

### Objectives

Implement a system to guarantee the child processes are resumed in accordance to their order in a __FIFO__
queue. That is, a FIFO queue is used to determine the sequence that child processes will be resumed:
The child at the front of the queue is next to be resumed.

For simplicity, a child will repeatedly generate a random integer and test if it's a factor of some integer
X (see below), until it generates a random integer less than 100 or is divisible by X, then it yields its
turn to the next child process. That is, it enqueues itself for its next turn, resumes the next child in the
queue and halts.

To make the programming more interesting: Four child processes will be spawned to compute whether
some integer is a factor of: **U=827395609 or V=962094883.** One of the child processes works
concurrently on integer U, as another child works on integer V, while the other 2 child processes wait
for their turn. **No two child processes can operate on the same integer.** The parent process (oldest)
prompts for exit command: **"!wq".** All processes will terminate on this input string. (Itâ€™s not important
what each software outputs on the console.)s

When a child is resumed & continues its execution, it needs to determine which of the 2 integers U or
V to work on. Again, no two child processes can operate on the same integer.
